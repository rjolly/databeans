Changes between 1.0 and 2.0rc13:

- redesigned the transaction mechanism, which was unstable in case of concurrent access (notably to collections) based on atomic actions and method call logging
- class access permission based security system
- data beans no more remote objects, which allows to implement non-remote interfaces and greatly simplifies the task of persisting classes (for instance : collections)
- synchronization on PersistentObject fixed, now on Accessor (the former are not unique)
- strengthened concurrency, removed synchronizations where not needed
- improved the exceptions
- PersistentClass now extends PersistentObject
- PersistentObject constructors replaced by init() methods
- "Persistent" prefix removed from Collection (and PropertyChangeSupport) classes
- persistent TreeMap, TreeSet, LinkedHashMap, LinkedHashSet
- import/export on client rather than server side
- imported the project in netbeans
- "getting_started" tour entirely based on ant tasks
