Changes between 2.0rc13 and 2.0rc14:

+ array classes not put in cache

Changes between 1.0 and 2.0rc13:

+ redesigned the transaction mechanism, which was unstable in case of concurrent access (notably to collections) based on atomic actions and method call logging
+ class access permission based security system
+ data beans no more remote objects, which allows collections (for instance) to implement non-remote interfaces
+ synchronization on PersistentObject fixed, now on Accessor (the former are not unique)
+ strengthened concurrency, removed synchronizations where not needed
+ improved the exceptions
+ PersistentClass now extends PersistentObject which allows to emulate static fields
+ PersistentObject constructors replaced by init() methods
+ "Persistent" prefix removed from Collection (and PropertyChangeSupport) classes
+ persistent HashSet, TreeMap, TreeSet, LinkedHashMap, LinkedHashSet
+ import/export on client rather than server side
+ imported the project in netbeans
+ distinct admin port supressed
+ "getting_started" tour entirely based on ant tasks
